#F2F
### The meeting app for familiar strangers
With F2F (face-to-face), you can connect people nearby, which use the same application. It allows you to see other people in the map and it notifies you when someone with similar interests are nearby.

This is made in Oulu university course 521148S Ubiquitous Computing Fundamentals.
